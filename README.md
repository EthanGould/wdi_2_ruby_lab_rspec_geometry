# RSpec Geometry

Using test-driven development with RSpec, create the following classes:

### `Rectangle`

* Has a length and a width
* Has methods that return its perimeter and area

### `Circle`

* Has a radius
* Has methods that return its circumference and area

### `Triangle`

* Has three side lengths
* Has methods that return its perimeter and area
* Has a method that determines whether the triangle is valid (hint: use the Inequality Theorem)

**Bonus:** Prevent invalid triangles from being created in the first place by raising an `ArgumentError`. The method that checks for validity can now be private &ndash; why is this?
